My name is John Doe, and I am a software engineer with over 8 years of experience in full-stack development. I specialize in Node.js, React, and cloud technologies like AWS and Google Cloud Platform.

I have worked at several tech companies, including a startup where I built scalable microservices architecture and a Fortune 500 company where I led a team of 6 developers. My expertise includes building RESTful APIs, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and working with databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

In my current role, I focus on developing AI-powered applications and have experience with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. I'm passionate about clean code, test-driven development, and mentoring junior developers.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from MIT and have several certifications including AWS Solutions Architect and Google Cloud Professional Developer. I enjoy hiking, reading technical books, and contributing to open-source projects in my free time.

I'm currently working on a personal project involving natural language processing and retrieval-augmented generation systems. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest technology trends.
